	<h1><b> Concerned about Trent's new vaccination policy? </b></h1>
	<h1><b> You are not alone. <b></h1>
	<p> We are a group of a students from Trent University who believe that vaccination is a personal medical decision to be made without coercion. </p>
	<p> We consider Trent's recent decision to require students to dislose their vaccination status and treat them differently because of it to be intrusive, divisive, unscientific and grossly unethical. </p>
	<p> We strongly oppose any mandatory vaccination policy on campus. </p>
	<p> We completely understand the need to keep everyone safe at this time while advocating that this be done in a way that does not infringe upon the rights of students. </p>
	<p> Our goal is to unite liberty-minded Trent students under one banner to stand against these sorts of attacks on our freedoms. <a href="mailto:trentstudents4vaccinechoice@protonmail.com">Contact</a> us today!</p>
