	<title> Trent Students for Vaccine Choice </title>
	<h1> Concerned about Trent's new vaccination policy? </h1>
	<h2> You are not alone. </h2>
	</body>
	<p> We are a group of a students from Trent University who believe that vaccination is a personal medical decision to be made without compulsion. </p>
	<p> We view Trent's recent decision to require students to have received both doses of the COVID19 vaccine in order to attend classes on campus to be coercive, intrusive, unscientific and grossly unethical. </p>
	<p> Our goal is to unite liberty-minded Trent students under one banner to stand against these sorts of attacks on our freedoms. Contact us at trentstudents4vaccinechoice@protonmail.com today! </p>
