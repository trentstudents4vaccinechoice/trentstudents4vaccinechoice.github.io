	<title> Trent Students for Vaccine Choice </title>
	<h1> Concerned about Trent's new vaccination policy? </h1>
	<h2> You are not alone. </h2>
	</body>
	<p> We are a group of a students from Trent University who believe that vaccination is a personal medical decision to be made without compulsion. </p>
	<p> We consider Trent's recent decision to require students to dislose their vaccination status and treat them differently because of it to be intrusive, unscientific and grossly unethical. </p>
	<p> We completely oppose any effort on part of Trent to mandate that all students be vaccinated im order to access campus. </p>
	<p> We fully empathize with the need to keep everyone safe at this time while advocating that this be done in a way that is minimally restrictive on the rights of students. </p>
	<p> Our goal is to unite liberty-minded Trent students under one banner to stand against these sorts of attacks on our freedoms. <a href="mailto:trentstudents4vaccinechoice@protonmail.com">Contact</a> us today!</p>
